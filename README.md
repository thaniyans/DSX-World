# <a name="create-project"></a>Step 2. Create a project

1. Click on the left hand side "hamburger" icon and then click on My Projects to see a list of your projects. You should only see a default project.

 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/my-projects.png?raw=true"/>

2. Click on the create project icon on the top right of the project list.

 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/create-new-project.png?raw=true" />

3. Type a name for your project. For instance, "DSX Lab". A Spark service and an object storage will be automatically selected as well as a container with a default name. A container is a directory on the object storage. Click on Create.

 > You are now in your new project where you can create notebooks and data assets as well as add collaborators.

# <a name="load-data"></a>Step 3. Get the data into DSX


1. [Click here to download this repository](https://github.com/IBMDataScience/SparkSummitDemo/archive/master.zip) to your computer to access the data stored in the data directory.

2. Unzip this zip file on your computer so you have a directory with all the assets in the repository.  We will be using the data from the data directory.  The screenshot below shows dragging the contents to the desktop for easy access:

2. Go to your recently created project on DSX and click on the add data assets + icon

 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/add-data-asset.png"/>

3. Click on the Add file and select the transactions.csv file from your computer and click on open

 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/add-file.png" width="450" height="275"/>

5. Once the file is loaded, click on Apply to add this file to your project.

 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/apply-file.png" width="450" height="275"/>
 
 > Click Apply on the pop-up:
 
 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/apply-changes.png" width="500" height="225"/>

  > You should see transactions.csv under the data assets list of your project. Your data is  now loaded in your object storage in the container associated to your project. If your project name is "DSX Lab", the default container name is DSXLab (unless you change to a different name on Step 2, part 3).

# <a name="importing-notebooks"></a>Step 4. Importing Notebooks for Machine Learning Lab


1. From the your project page, on the "Overview" tab click "add notebook"
 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/add-notebook.png" />
2. In the next screen named “Create Notebook”, switch to “From File” tab, name the notebook “ML Lab Installation”, and choose the notebook file on your disk from the archive: notebooks/ml-lab-installation.ipynb; alternatively you can switch to “From  URL” tab and use the following “Notebook URL”:
 >  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBMDataScience/SparkSummitDemo/master/BlocPower%20with%20Sparkling.ipynb
 
 >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/notebook-from-url.png" width="512" height="499"/>
3. Click Create Notebook at the bottom of the page to add the notebook
4. Run all the cells in the notebook clicking on the Run All option under Cells
  >  <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/run-all.png" width="435" height="207"/>
5. Once the libraries have been installed, all the cells will have a number present on the left side of the notebook between square brackets.
   >  
   <img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/complete-notebook.png"  width="435" height="207"/>
6. Click File -> Save or the Floppy disk icon to save the notebook 
7. Return back to the project overview page by clicking on "DSX Lab" or the name you gave your project
 >NOTE: the software packages installation may take a few minutes, but it
 >needs to be done only once per account
8.  Load the second notebook “Machine Learning with DSX - Lab” (from the file machine-learning-with-DSX-lab.ipynb, or from URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/master/notebooks/machine-learning-with-DSX-lab.ipynb ) by following the same steps 1-3 as above


# <a name="object-data"></a>Step 5. Adding data from Object Storage in the Notebook

1.  From the loaded notebook “Machine Learning with DSX Lab” click on "Find and add data": 
<img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/Selecting-Data-Sources.jpg"  width="230" height="189"/>   
2.  The expanded "Find and add data" would show transaction.csv under “Files” section

3.  Follow the instructions in the cell of the notebook shown below:

<img src="https://github.com/IBMDataScience/wow-lab-to-production/blob/master/images/adding-data-in-notebook.png"/> 
4.  After inserting the code, at then end you will see something that looks like this:
     



- For the Spark Service, select the service created in step 1 that has the Object Store associated with it, create the notebook
- To read the data from the right location, the container name chosen in step 1 needs to be inserted in the first three code cells
- For the code example below, my container was named notebooks (default in Data Science Experience):
  ```
    file1 = 'swift://notebooks.spark/BlocPower_T.csv'
 ```
- If you forgot your container name, click on Data Source on the right side bar and click "Manage Files".  This will take you to Data Hub where you can see the name of your container.
- Before you get started, double check that you have all the necessary libraries installed by clicking Environment on the right side panel and review the list of Python libraries. 

 ![environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBMDataScience/SparkSummitDemo/master/Screenshots/environment.png)

  - If you are missing one of these libraries you can install it using Python pip installer using the code below where we install ```myLibrary```:

```
!pip install --user --pre myLibrary
```

- Now you can run each cell to recreate the analysis
- Follow along each of the following steps:
  - Data cleaning
  - Fitting a linear regression model
  - Conducting k-means clustering

###### 3. Running the Shiny App - Flex Dashboard
- Open RStudio in Data Science Experience from the left navigation bar 
- Create a new R Markdown Document - note you may be required to download some R packages at this time
- Copy the raw [R Markdown from here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBMDataScience/SparkSummitDemo/master/shinyDemo.Rmd)
- Replace the default content in the new R Markdown file by pasting the code in the file
- Select lines 21 - 65 and execute (This is a one time set up to install all necessary packages)
- Click the Knit button with the ball of yarn next to it
- Ignore the error on the pop-up and click the button "Open in Browser" to see the app in a web browser
- Open the app in a browser to interact with it, share the link with anyone
